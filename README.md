# News
A news app that shows a list of news items when the user taps one of the items,
a so-called detail view is displayed. All implementation of the code is Neat and
well-commented.In running the code, it can be seen that the first view is a list of all news
(left image) with the title of the news and author and when the user taps on an item, more detail
is shown (right image). An Image, Title of news, Author, and details of news as‚ÄúDescription‚Äù.
Also, in the code, Imports are assigned to help allow my code to access symbols that are declared in other files.
Furthermore, the struct aim is to provide storage of data using properties with extended functionality using methods.
For a struct, it provides storage of data using properties with extended functionality using methods to enable
the User to See the preview of the News(Data) and finally perform a specific task named updateUIView(Update the data
or the news). Other, implementation have been done in the code and have been well commented for understanding.
The news is demoed in a Virtual IOS app on a Virtual iPhone 11 in this case, and a video is provided to see how
it is demonstrated.
Thank you üôÇ.
